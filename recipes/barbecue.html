        <h3>Barbecue is a cooking method where meat is slow-cooked over a fire or hot coals, often seasoned with a flavorful marinade or sauce.</h3>
        <p>A barbecue recipe typically involves marinating meat, such as ribs, chicken, or brisket, with a blend of spices, herbs, and sauces. The meat is then cooked slowly over indirect heat on a grill or smoker, allowing the flavors to develop and the meat to become tender. The result is a smoky, savory dish with a crispy exterior and juicy, flavorful interior.</p>

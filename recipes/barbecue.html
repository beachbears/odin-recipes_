        <h3>Barbecue is a cooking method where meat is slow-cooked over a fire or hot coals, often seasoned with a flavorful marinade or sauce.</h3>
        <p>A barbecue recipe typically involves marinating meat, such as ribs, chicken, or brisket, with a blend of spices, herbs, and sauces. The meat is then cooked slowly over indirect heat on a grill or smoker, allowing the flavors to develop and the meat to become tender. The result is a smoky, savory dish with a crispy exterior and juicy, flavorful interior.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 kilo pork</li>
            <li>Olive oil or vegetable oil for brushing</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To make BBQ chicken, prepare a homemade sauce by combining ingredients like ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, mustard, and spices. Simmer until thickened and set aside.</li>
            <li>Brush chicken with olive oil, season with salt, pepper, and paprika, and grill over medium-high heat for 20-25 minutes, turning occasionally. For thicker cuts, like drumsticks, grill for 30-40 minutes.</li>
            <li>In the final minutes, brush the chicken with BBQ sauce and allow it to caramelize. Be careful not to burn the sauce.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes. Serve with extra BBQ sauce and garnish with fresh herbs.</li>
        </ol>

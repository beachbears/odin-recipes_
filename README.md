# odin-recipes_
I am going to make a basic recipe website.
The skills I want to demonstrate are:
1 Creating a boilerplate my own without using short cut
2 Use the CLI in manipulating my directories and file as much as possible
3 Use all the elements and tags with their correct attributes 
4 Committing more often while ensuring the quality in each commit
